### Hi there 👋
<h2 align='center'>About Me</h2>
<p>With a Bachelor degree in Computer Science & Engineering and more than 5 years of IT/Software Industry experience, I have recently completed a course (Certificate IV in Information Technology) from TAFE and currently doing an intense 12 week bootcamp program in Web Development. My natural analytical and problem solving skills and my interest in building websites have led me to look for a career change to front end design and development. I am a self-motivated, quick learner, strong work ethics and committed to pursuing a long term career by utilizing my expertise for the benefit of the organisation.</p>
